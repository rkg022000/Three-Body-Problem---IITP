# Three-Body-Problem-Animation

**Index File is the Homepage.

This Project aims on showing a visual representation of how a 3 body problem only under gravitational forces would look in real life.

Input Parameters:
 -- Radii of the 3 spherical balls(bodies)
 -- Masses of the 3 bodies
 -- Initial Positions of the bodies in vector form (i j k)  ## Remember to give space between the values of i, j & k
 -- Initial Velocitiess of the bodies in vector form (i j k)  ## Remember to give space between the values of i, j & k

 Output:
 -- You will see the output on the white screen in your browser as soon as the correct input parameters are accepted

 Controls:
 -- Pause/Play - Temporarily pause or play the animation
 -- Restart - Restart the animation from the beggining
 -- Animation Speed Slider - The Maximum and Minimum values of this slider to adjust the animation speed is set automatically by the program

 Things used:
 -- Glowscript is an open source powerful environment for creating 3D Animations and publishing on web
 -- VPython is used for the driver code for the logic to be converted into animation
 -- The Standard 3 body problem here is sloved under only the effects of the gravitational forces between the bodies and momentum conservations equations
